Watcher:-> observer Desing Pattern
Rendering:->Composite Desing Pattern
 Composite Component Contain 
 this four Component
  1) Component -> Commmon Interface
  2) Composite -> Iam a Component with Children
  3) Leaf:     -> Iam a Component without Children
  4) Client:   -> I manipulate objects in the Composition



Component:-> It is a Common Interface
Leaf:-> it is inherit from Component
Composite:-> inherit From Component + Compose Collection Component 

Client Can Manipulate without Knowing the Leaf or Composite to do Operation...?
